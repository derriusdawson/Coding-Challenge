# Create a program using maths and f-Strings that tells us how many 
# days, weeks, months we have left if we live until 90 years old.
​
# It will take your current age as the input and output a message 
# with our time left in this format:
​
# You have x days, y weeks, and z months left.
​
# Where x, y and z are replaced with the actual calculated numbers.
