What is this repo all about?
  This repo contains beginner level coding challenges.  It contains Bash and Powershell scripts. 
Why are you learning these skills?
    As a cybersecurity professional, it is important to have baseline knowledge of coding.  This can help you automate tasks for clients that they were potentially causing problems with trying to do themselves. 
What fundamental concepts did you learn in Ops 201?
  Automation Scripts, defining variables, loops, arrays
What was your favorite Ops Challenge assignment and why?
  I enjoyed the Ops Challenges that used Powershell.  I liked those because you can use Powershell ISE which gives you a list of all commands and potential parameters for them. 
How can these examples of shell scripting be applied to the workplace?
    You can use shell scripting to automate tasks, as well as to pull valuable information about a PC such as the IP Address, CPU info, and RAM info.
What scripts would you continue to improve if you had the time?
    Arrays and Loops
What aspect of your shell scripting skills do you hope to improve next?
  I want to improve on writing loops and defining/calling variables.
